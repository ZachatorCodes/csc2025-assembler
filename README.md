# CSC2025 (Computer Architecture & Assemble Language) Assembler Project
This GitHub repository contains the code for my Assembler Project. All parts are tested using a seperate ASM file, with one main ASM final as a final test.

## Part 1 / 2
Create code that will take in a line of ASM code and break it into the three parts.
Additionally, write the C code that converts the ASM into binary and stores it into memory. It should be able to move a constant into a register and moves numbers from register to register.
The halt command should also be working after this part.

## Part 3
Create code that can add two numbers (either constants or from the registers) and can output the value of the AX register.

## Part 4
Create code that allows the storing of values (either constants or from the registers) into specific memory locations.

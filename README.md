# Computer Architecture & Assemble Language Assembler Project
This GitHub repository contains the code for my CSC2025 Assembler Project. All parts are tested using a seperate ASM file, with one main ASM final as a final test.

## Part 1 / 2
Create code that will take in a line of ASM code and break it into the three parts.
Additionally, write the C code that converts the ASM into binary and stores it into memory. It should be able to move a constant into a register and moves numbers from register to register.
The halt command should also be working after this part.

## Part 3
Create code that can add two numbers (either constants or from the registers) and can output the value of the AX register using the PUT command.

## Part 4
Create code that allows the storing of values (either constants or from the registers) into specific memory locations.

## Part 5
Make sure that values can be moved from register to memory and vice versa.
Additionally, make sure that blank lines can be handled and that numbers can be read from the console.
Make sure that adding works between both registers and memory values.
